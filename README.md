## I want to contribute to open source because
### The coolest thing about open source is making/creating things for others. While using open-source you create code that benefits the community. No matter what kind of contribution you’re making…either it’s documentation, minor changes in code, or just opening an issue, you certainly improve the tools or software and make life easier for other developers.
